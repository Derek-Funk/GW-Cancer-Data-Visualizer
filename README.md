# GW-Cancer-Data-Visualizer

## Abstract
This is a visualizer tool to explore cancer rates and related variables in the DC-Maryland-Virginia metropolitan area. I developed this tool for the George Washington Cancer Center as part of my Master of Data Science capstone project at the George Washington University. All the data shown in this tool are publicly available information.
